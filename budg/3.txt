 The presentation of Budget for 2013-14 to the Assembly on Friday was briefly disrupted by Opposition protests over remarks made by Chief Whip P.C. George against JSS leader K.R. Gouriamma and the late CPI leader T. V. Thomas.

In a marked departure from convention, the Speaker G. Karthikeyan allowed Opposition Leader V. S. Achuthanandan to intervene after Finance Minister K. M. Mani began his speech.

The Opposition Leader told the House that it was unbecoming of the Chief Whip to have made remarks against past leaders such as Mr. Thomas and demanded that Mr. George should be restrained from making such remarks. “The dignity of the House should be upheld,” the former chief minister said.

Chief Minister Oommen Chandy said that the government did not agree to portraying past leaders in poor light.

Mr. George then expressed regret over his comment as have been reported in television channels.

However, Deputy Leader of the CPI (M) Kodiyeri Balakrishnan demanded the Chair should take action against Mr. George in accordance with the House rules. The Speaker said that he would examine matter.
