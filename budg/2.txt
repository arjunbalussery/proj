 The Mumbai Sessions court has postponed the hearing related to the enhancement of charges against actor Salman Khan in the 2002 hit-and-run case to April 8. 

The court was to decide today if the actor can be charged with the more stringent -culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

The actor was earlier being tried for rash and negligent driving, which carries a maximum sentence of two years. In January the court handling his case accepted that the police has provided evidence that merits trying the actor under the tougher charges which attracts a punishment upto ten years in prison.
The magistrate had then transferred the matter to the Sessions Court as it didn't have the jurisdiction to hear the case. 

Last month Salman Khan challenged the order and filed a revision petition, pleading that the more stringent charges be dropped. 

The case goes back to 2002, when the actor's SUV had run into a bakery in suburban Bandra, killing one and injuring four persons who were sleeping on the pavement outside.
