It has been rightly said that necessity is the mother of inventions. Most of the inventions and discoveries owe their successful operation to necessity. Unless there is want we cannot struggle to attain the goal. The history of human progress in all walks of life is the history of man's endeavour to reach new goals.

When man felt hungry, he started hunting and till land. The need for shelter lead the man to built huts and houses. The need for quick travel resulted in the invention of the fastest means of transport, making the world short. At the time of necessity, the human mind, which is creative and imaginative, thinks in a very quick manner.

In this age of science where a race is going on, deadly weapons are being manufactured due to necessity. The fear of the enemy has forced the power-hungry countries to invent such destructive weapons of death.

The proverbial crow's necessity of water forced it to find out the way to quench its thirst. In the political life it is again the necessity which leads us to think of new forms of government-whether Socialistic or otherwise in pattern.

As new needs arise, fresh methods are devised to meet them New plans are hatched to find solutions to different problems. Necessity makes us bold, zealous and eager enough to fulfil our needs. Necessity is a blessing in disguise.

What is impossible in the world? Man can achieve anything he wants provided he puts in hard labour and sincere efforts. Where there is a will there is a way. Constant efforts do bear fruit. Where there is any necessity, there is some invention, some research, in order to fulfil that necessity. All our inventions and discoveries are the direct result of our pressing needs.
