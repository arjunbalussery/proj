India beat Australia by six wickets in the third cricket Test to go 3-0 up in their best-of-four contest and regain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

Virat Kohli top scored with 34 and home captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni smashed three straight boundaries to help guide India past the victory target of 133 with 15 balls to spare on day five in Mohali. Australia was earlier dismissed for 223 in its second innings.

India will now seek to avenge its 4-0 sweep of losses in Australia in 2011-12 by winning the final Test, which starts March 22 in Delhi. The Australians have lost six straight elite five-day matches in India.
