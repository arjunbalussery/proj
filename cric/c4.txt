India Chases 133 Runs to Win Test Cricket Series Over Australia.

India needs 133 runs to secure a Test series cricket victory against Australia after bowling out the touring team for 223 after lunch on the final day of the third match in Mohali.

India, which is seeking to regain the Border-Gavaskar trophy after a 4-0 sweep of losses in Australia in 2011-12, has a minimum of 27 overs in which to get the runs and go 3-0 up in the four-match contest.

Bhuvneshwar Kumar finished as India’s best bowler, taking 3-31, with left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja picking up 3-35. Phil Hughes top scored with 69 for Australia, which had resumed at 75-3 in its second innings.

Mitchell Starc was out for 35 after combining with Xavier Doherty to hold up India’s victory push with a 44-run stand for the last wicket, the biggest partnership of the innings.

Cricket Australia said vice-captain Shane Watson, who returned home for the birth of his first child after being among a group of four players suspended for the match for disciplinary reasons, will rejoin the squad for the final Test, which starts March 22 in Delhi.
